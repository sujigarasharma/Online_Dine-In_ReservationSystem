# Online Dine-In Reservation System

"YUMMY" is an online dine in reservation system with the covid-19 safety measures. The overall aim of this project is to design and implement an online restaurant reservation system that would enable diners to reserve tables at restaurants and order food to take at dine in . This system was mainly designed for the Covid-19 restriction rules which was released by Indian government (allowance of 50% of the customer). Our system gives a multiple dining reservation options like single, double and family , parties and celebration for the customers with covid-19 protocols. Also we have included the time limit for each reservations and notifying the exit time limit to the customer. Our system enables a necessary option for the customer to upload the vaccination certificate. Temperature check will be taken at the check in time and then admin will enter this data. YUMMY is a easy to use solution which definitely helps us to run consistently smooth shifts , grow guest relationship and drive more revenue.
